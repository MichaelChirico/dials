# `dials`

This package contains tools to create and manage values of tuning parameters and is designed to integrate well with the [`parsnip`](https://github.com/topepo/parsnip) package. 

The name reflects the idea that tuning predictive models can be like turning a set of dials on a complex machine under duress.
